# ztranslate

## description
have you ever found yourself confused by gen z slang? do you ever scroll on tiktok and wonder if words like "ohio", "skibidi", "gyatt", or "fanum tax" even belong in a same language? 

well, me too. i certainly can't keep up with all of the new slang that evolves seemingly each day, which is why i decided to build **ztranslate**, where i'm hoping to create a translation interface that converts gen-z vernacular into classic english and vice versa.

**backend**: supabase
**frontend**: react
