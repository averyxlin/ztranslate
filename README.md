# ztranslate

## description
have you ever found yourself confused by gen z slang? do you ever scroll on tiktok and wonder if words like "ohio", "skibidi", "gyatt", or "fanum tax" even belong in a same language? 

well, me too - i honestly can't keep up with all of the new slang that evolves seemingly each day, which is why i decided to build **ztranslate**, where i'm hoping to create a translation interface that converts gen-z vernacular into classic english and vice versa.

i also wanted an excuse to learn how to use supabase and redux for state management, and the ui of a translating app is pretty straightforward so it allows me to focus on those technologies :D

## technologies
- **backend**: supabase
- **frontend**: react, tailwind-css, hyperui, redux
