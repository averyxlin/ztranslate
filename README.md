# ztranslate

## description
have you ever found yourself confused by gen z slang? do you ever scroll on tiktok and wonder if words like "ohio", "skibidi", "gyatt", or "fanum tax" even belong in a same language? 

well, me too - i honestly can't keep up with all of the new slang that evolves seemingly each day, which is why i decided to build **ztranslate**, where i'm hoping to create a translation interface that converts gen-z vernacular into classic english and vice versa.

 the ui of a translating app is really straightforward so i can focus on learning how to use supabase as a database, and redux for state management. the states themselves are also really straightforward and that lets me focus on concepts of redux, e.g. store, actions, reducers.

## technologies
- **backend**: supabase
- **frontend**: react, tailwind-css, hyperui, redux
